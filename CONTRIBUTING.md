# Contributing Guide
Thanks for your interest in improving vscode-vba!

## Creating Issues
Before you create a new issue, please first search in [open issues][issues] to check it is not already reported.

In case your issue already exists, add a reaction and possibly create relevant comments.

Otherwise proceed with opening a new one.

## Creating Pull Requests
> Before making bigger changes, please discuss them in an issue.

In general PRs should be kept as small as possible (e.g. one feature/fix per PR).
It allows merging them faster with less conflicts and will reduce review time.

### Repository Setup
- Install the Bait programming language: https://github.com/tiabeast/bait#building-from-source
- Create and clone a fork of https://github.com/serkonda7/vscode-vba
- Run `npm install` inside the cloned directory
- Create a new working branch for your changes

### Unit Tests
Every PR should contain a test case that covers the added feature or bug fix.
This prevents regressions and makes reviewing the changes easier by proofing correct functionality.

Tests for the language grammar (syntax highlighting) are in [`syntaxes/tests`](syntaxes/tests/).
They can be run with the following command:
```
npm run test
```

### Install a dev version
If you'd like to install a development version of the extension, follow these steps:
1. ```sh
   npm run install-dev-ext
   ```
2. Reload the VS Code window:
   - Open command palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>)
   - Run `>reload window`

> Note: It is not required to uninstall any previous versions.

### Compilation and Linting
Currently there are no features that rely on Typescript.
Thus there is no need to compile or lint the code during development.
