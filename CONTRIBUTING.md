# Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in contributing to vscode-vba!


## Creating Issues
Report bugs or suggest new features.

Before opening an issue, please check that your issue or a similar one has not already been reported in the [open issues][issues].

In case it already is, add a reaction and any additional information.


## Pull Request Best Practices
- **Discuss bigger changes:** For significant changes, please discuss them first , so no effort is wasted.
- **Small and focused PRs:**  Aim for one feature or bug fix per pull request. This simplifies reviews and accelerates merging


## Syntax Highlighting Grammar (Regexes and Scopes)
VS Code uses TextMate Grammars and Oniguruma regexes.

Oniguruma is mostly compatible with PCRE _([Comparison][oniguruma-overview])_,
so [regexr][regexr] in PCRE mode is a good choice for development.

For a list of predefined grammar scopes see the [TextMate Manual][textmate-manual].

To manually inspect the scopes in the editor,
execute `Developer: Inspect Tokens and Scopes` from the command palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>).


### Unit Tests
Ensure your PR contains tests to cover the feature or bug fix.
This prevents regressions and makes reviewing the changes easier by providing a proof of correct functionality.

Tests for the language grammar are in [`syntaxes/tests/`](syntaxes/tests/).
Run them using:
```
pnpm run test
```


## Snippets
Adding snippets is as simple as editing [`snippets/vba_snippets.yml`](snippets/vba_snippets.yml).

Refer to the [official documentation][docs-snippets] for guidance.

> Note: Uninstalling previous versions is not necessary.


## Development Environment Setup

1. Install development tools
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
      - The latest version should work fine
      - Otherwise use [NVM][nvm] for management: `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18`
   - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): `pnpm -v || npm install -g pnpm`
