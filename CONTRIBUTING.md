# Contributing
Thank you for taking the time to contribute :tada:

Before making changes, please discuss them in an issue.

## Testing
Every PR should contain a test case that covers the added feature or bug fix.
This prevents regressions and makes reviewing the changes easier by proofing correct functionality.

Tests for the language grammar providing the syntax highlighting are in [`syntaxes/tests`](syntaxes/tests/).
They can be run with the following command:
```
npm run test
```

## Repository Setup
Create and clone a fork of https://github.com/serkonda7/vscode-vba.
Inside the cloned directory run `npm install`.

## Compilation and Linting
Currently there are no features that rely on typescript.
Thus there is no need to compile or lint the code during development.

## Packaging
Installation packages (.vsix) can be generated by the following command:
```
npm run package
```
